        "response": "### Change of Control Triggering Event\n\nThe definition of 'Change of Control' includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis) to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase 'substantially all', there is no precise established definition of the phrase under the laws of the State of New York, which is the applicable law that governs the Indenture. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of 'all or substantially all' of the assets of the Parent Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis). As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control Triggering Event has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control Triggering Event[1].\n\n### Risks Relating to Notes\n\nOne of the circumstances under which a change of control may occur is upon the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of our assets. However, the phrase 'all or substantially all' will likely be interpreted under applicable state law and will be dependent upon particular facts and circumstances. As a result, there may be a degree of uncertainty in ascertaining whether a sale or disposition of 'all or substantially all' of our assets has occurred, in which case the ability of a holder of the Notes to obtain the benefit of an offer to repurchase all or a portion of the Notes held by such holder may be impaired[2].\n\n### Future Indebtedness and Repurchase Obligations\n\nFuture Indebtedness that the Parent Guarantor may incur may contain prohibitions on the occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control, or require the repurchase of such indebtedness upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase their Notes could cause a default under such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not. Finally, the ability of the Issuer to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event may be limited by the then existing financial resources of the Issuer and the Note Guarantors. The Issuer cannot assure you that it will have sufficient funds available when necessary to make any required repurchases[3].\n\n### Credit Agreement and Review Event\n\nA Change of Control may be a change of control under the Credit Agreement, which would be a 'review event' thereunder. The occurrence of a 'review event' may, under certain circumstances described in the Credit Agreement, require the Parent Guarantor and the Issuer to repay the Indebtedness outstanding under the Credit Agreement and result in the cancelation of the lending commitments thereunder. In addition, events that may not constitute a Change of Control may constitute a change of control under the Credit Agreement and accordingly constitute a review event[4].",
