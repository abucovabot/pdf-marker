        "name": "Risk factors",
        "response": "### Risk Factors Relating to Issuer\n\nNexans faces a variety of **strategic risks** primarily linked to geopolitical, political, and social instability, particularly in high-growth regions. In 2023, approximately **9%** of the Group's sales were generated from the Middle East and Africa, regions classified by the Group's credit insurer as having an \"unsettled economic political environment.\" The ongoing conflict between **Russia and Ukraine** has also posed risks, although the Group's total assets in Ukraine represent less than **1%** of its consolidated balance sheet. The Group's strategy includes expanding into high-growth regions, such as South America and Africa, which may expose it to significant geopolitical risks. For instance, political tensions in **Peru** and **Ecuador** following recent elections have been closely monitored. Additionally, the evolving relations between **China and the United States** could impact trade policies and export regulations, affecting the Group's business activities.\n\n### Competitive Environment Risks\n\nThe Group operates in a highly competitive environment, particularly in the **medium and low voltage cable markets**, where competition is both regional and international. The emergence of new market players over the last decade has intensified competition, leading to potential decreases in sales volumes and pressure on selling prices. The **high voltage cable market** is also experiencing increased competition from existing operators and new entrants, which could impact the Group's market position. In response, Nexans has prioritized innovative technologies and investments to differentiate its offerings, ensuring high-quality project execution and maintaining a balanced backlog through rigorous risk-reward analysis.\n\n### M&A Related Risks\n\nNexans pursues a strategy to become a pure player in electrification, which involves both acquiring targets in the electrification sector and divesting non-core activities. This strategy carries risks related to the realization of identified synergies, compliance, and integration challenges that could affect operational performance. The Group has implemented a detailed market analysis process to identify suitable merger and acquisition opportunities, ensuring alignment with its strategic objectives. A robust governance structure, including a Mergers & Acquisitions Committee, oversees the evaluation and approval of acquisition and divestment projects, which undergo thorough due diligence to identify potential risks.\n\n### Operational Risks\n\nThe Group is exposed to operational risks, particularly related to **cybersecurity** and the continuity of its information systems. As Nexans relies heavily on information technology, the risk of cyber-attacks is significant, with potential impacts including financial loss, reputational damage, and operational disruptions. The Group has established a dedicated cybersecurity team to manage these risks, conducting regular security audits and implementing a comprehensive cybersecurity program. Additionally, the Group faces risks associated with the physical integrity of its manufacturing sites, which are subject to natural disasters and climate change impacts. The Group has invested in adaptation measures to mitigate these risks, including facility design improvements and emergency management plans.\n\n### Climate Change and Natural Hazards Risks\n\nNexans acknowledges the risks associated with climate change and natural hazards, particularly as its manufacturing sites are located in areas prone to natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes. The Group has conducted physical risk analyses to assess vulnerabilities and has implemented adaptation measures to enhance the resilience of its facilities. Furthermore, the Group is committed to reducing its environmental impact and addressing stakeholder expectations regarding climate risks, which could present both challenges and opportunities in the evolving energy landscape.\n\n### Financial Risks\n\nNexans faces various financial risks, including **metal price volatility**, interest rate fluctuations, liquidity risks, and currency risks. The Group's operations are significantly impacted by the prices of non-ferrous metals, particularly copper and aluminum, which are essential raw materials. Price fluctuations can affect the Group's earnings and operational costs. To mitigate these risks, Nexans employs a strategy of securing long-term contracts for metal supplies and utilizes hedging strategies to manage price volatility. Additionally, the Group's exposure to interest rate changes is monitored closely, with a significant portion of its debt being fixed-rate to limit the impact of rising interest rates on its financial results. \n\n### Legal Compliance Risks\n\nNexans is subject to various legal compliance risks, including those related to antitrust laws and anti-bribery legislation. The Group has faced investigations and fines related to alleged anticompetitive behavior in the past, which could have financial and reputational implications. To address these risks, Nexans has implemented a comprehensive compliance program that includes training for employees and regular audits to ensure adherence to legal standards. The Group also faces risks associated with environmental regulations, which could lead to liability claims and significant costs related to compliance and remediation efforts. \n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn summary, Nexans operates in a complex environment characterized by various risks that could impact its business operations and financial performance. The Group's proactive risk management strategies aim to mitigate these risks while positioning the company for sustainable growth in the electrification sector.",

        "response": "### RISK FACTORS\n\nThe **Risk Factors** section outlines potential risks associated with the Notes, which are rated **BB+** by S&P. It emphasizes that the market value of the Notes is influenced by various factors, including the **creditworthiness** of the Issuer, prevailing **market interest rates**, and the time remaining until the **maturity date**. The document warns that the price at which a Noteholder can sell the Notes in the secondary market may be significantly lower than the purchase price, potentially resulting in a loss of capital. Additionally, the existence of an active trading market for the Notes is uncertain, and if such a market does not develop or is adversely affected, liquidity could be compromised, further impacting the ability to sell the Notes at favorable prices.\n\n### NEGATIVE PLEDGE\n\nThe **Negative Pledge** provision states that as long as the Notes remain outstanding, the Issuer commits not to grant any **mortgage**, **pledge**, or **security interest** over its present or future real property assets unless the Notes are equally and rateably secured. This undertaking is designed to protect the interests of the Noteholders by ensuring that their claims are not subordinated to other creditors. The definition of \"outstanding\" includes Notes that have not been redeemed or canceled, ensuring that the pledge remains in effect until all obligations are fulfilled.\n\n### INTEREST\n\nThe **Interest** section specifies that the Notes will bear an interest rate of **4.250% per annum**, calculated from the **Issue Date** of **11 March 2024** until the **Maturity Date** of **11 March 2030**. Interest payments will be made annually in arrears on each **Interest Payment Date**, starting from **11 March 2025**. The interest calculation follows the **Actual/Actual-ICMA** method, which accounts for the actual number of days in the interest period, ensuring accurate accrual of interest until the redemption date. If the full amount due is not paid on the redemption date, interest will continue to accrue until the payment is received.\n\n### INTEREST ACCRUAL\n\nThe **Interest Accrual** provision clarifies that interest on the Notes ceases to accrue on the redemption date unless the payment is improperly withheld or refused. In such cases, interest will continue to accrue at the specified rate until either the payment is received by the relevant Noteholder or the sums due are received by **Euroclear France**. This provision ensures that Noteholders are compensated for any delays in payment, thereby protecting their financial interests.",

The Issuer's obligations under the Notes are characterized as **direct, unconditional, and unsubordinated**, subject to certain conditions.

Additionally, it highlights the **interest rate risk**, noting that changes in market interest rates could adversely affect the value of the Notes. The Notes bear interest at a rate of **4.250% per annum**, payable annually in arrears starting from **11 March 2025**. Furthermore, the market value of the Notes is influenced by various factors, including the Issuer's creditworthiness and broader economic conditions, which could lead to significant discounts if Noteholders decide to sell before maturity.\n\nOverall, the document serves as a comprehensive overview of the risks and structural features associated with the Notes, emphasizing the importance of understanding these factors before making investment decisions.",

The issuance is authorized by a resolution from the Board of Directors of the Issuer, Nexans, dated **17 January 2024**. The Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Jean-Christophe Juillard, is responsible for the issuance as of **4 March 2024**. The Issuer has entered into an **Agency Agreement** dated **7 March 2024** with Société Générale, which acts as the **Fiscal Agent**, **Paying Agent**, and **Calculation Agent**.\n\n### Risk Factors\n\nThe offering includes several risk factors that potential investors should consider. The **credit risk** associated with the Issuer indicates that there is a possibility the Issuer may be unable to meet its financial obligations regarding the Notes. The Notes are classified as **direct, unconditional, and unsubordinated** obligations of the Issuer, but they are subject to certain conditions that could impact the creditworthiness of the Issuer. Additionally, the **negative pledge** provision prevents the Issuer from incurring additional indebtedness that could rank equally with the Notes, which is designed to protect the interests of the Noteholders.\n\n### Redemption Conditions\n\nThe Notes may be redeemed prior to maturity under specific conditions. If an event of default occurs, the Issuer is obligated to pay additional amounts concerning the Notes. The Issuer may also redeem all or a specified percentage of the outstanding principal amount of the Notes, which could lead to a **liquidity risk** for Noteholders. Early redemption may result in lower yields than initially anticipated, and Noteholders may face challenges in reinvesting the proceeds at comparable yields.\n\n### Interest Rate and Market Risks\n\nThe Notes bear interest at a rate of **4.250% per annum**, payable annually in arrears starting from **11 March 2025**. Changes in market interest rates could adversely affect the value of the Notes, potentially leading to lower returns for Noteholders. The market value of the Notes is influenced by various factors, including the Issuer's creditworthiness and prevailing economic conditions. The Notes are rated **BB+ by S&P**, and their market value may fluctuate significantly, impacting the potential resale price for Noteholders.\n\n### Trading and Liquidity\n\nAn application has been made for the Notes to be admitted to trading on **Euronext Paris**. While an active trading market may develop, there is no assurance that it will be maintained. If the trading market becomes illiquid, Noteholders may find it difficult to sell their Notes without incurring significant discounts. The exercise of any **Put Options** available to Noteholders could also affect the liquidity of the Notes in the market. \n\nThis structured summary encapsulates the key elements of the bond offering, including the financial details, associated risks, and market conditions relevant to potential investors.",
