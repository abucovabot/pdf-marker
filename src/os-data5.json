The remainder will be invested in highly liquid short-term investments, treated as cash equivalents, and earmarked for gross debt reduction at maturity[1].\n\n### Deleveraging Plan\n\nThe issuer presented a €2 billion inorganic deleveraging plan on 8 May 2024, within the context of a conservative financial policy aimed at protecting the Group's \"Investment Grade\" rating. The plan includes divestments of approximately €700 million, including the sale of the Group's conventional signalling business in North America to Knorr-Bremse AG, expected to generate proceeds of approximately €630 million with closing anticipated in summer 2024. Additionally, the plan involves issuing Notes and a capital increase with preferential subscription rights amounting to approximately €1 billion, to be executed later in September 2024, subject to market conditions and AMF approval. The total proceeds of approximately €2.4 billion correspond to the €2 billion deleveraging, mainly due to the Notes' 50% Moody's debt content. The net proceeds from the issue of the Notes are estimated at approximately €744 million and are part of the aforementioned deleveraging plan[2].",

      "RESPONSE": "### Overview of Financial Risks\nThe bond document outlines several financial risks associated with the Notes, emphasizing the factors influencing their market value and the implications of exchange rate fluctuations. The document also discusses the structural risks related to the Notes, highlighting their subordinated status.\n\n### Market Value Influences\nThe market value of the Notes is contingent upon various interrelated factors, including the **creditworthiness of the Issuer**, and broader **economic, financial, and political events** both in France and globally. The Notes are expected to be rated **Ba2 by Moody’s**, while the Issuer’s long-term senior unsecured debt holds a **Baa3 rating with a negative outlook**. Any changes to these ratings, whether revised, lowered, suspended, or withdrawn, could adversely affect the market value of the Notes. Additionally, unsolicited ratings from independent agencies like S&P and Fitch could differ from those sought by the Issuer, potentially impacting the Notes' market value negatively [1].\n\n### Interest Rate and Market Conditions\nThe interest on the Notes, calculated based on the **Mid-Swap Rate** plus an applicable margin, is subject to fluctuations influenced by the level of the Mid-Swap Rate, its volatility, and prevailing market interest yield rates. These factors, along with economic, financial, and political events, can affect the price at which a Noteholder might sell the Notes, possibly at a substantial discount to the issue price, thereby negatively impacting the return on investment [2].\n\n### Exchange Rate Risks\nThe payment of principal and interest in Euros presents risks related to currency conversions for investors whose financial activities are denominated in a currency other than the Euro. Significant changes in exchange rates, including devaluation of the Euro or revaluation of the investor’s currency, could adversely affect the yield, principal value, and market value of the Notes when converted to the investor’s currency [3].\n\n### Structural Risks\nThe Notes are described as the **lowest ranking subordinated obligations** of the Issuer, constituting direct, unconditional, unsecured deeply subordinated obligations. They rank pari passu among present and future Parity Securities of the Issuer, which could influence the recovery prospects in the event of the Issuer’s financial distress [4].",

      "RESPONSE": "### Subordination Provisions\n\nThe notes are governed by the subordination provisions outlined in Article L.228-97 of the French Code de commerce. These notes represent direct, unconditional, unsecured, and deeply subordinated obligations of the issuer. They rank pari passu with the issuer's present and future parity securities and are subordinated to the issuer's present and future prêts participatifs and titres participatifs, as well as ordinary subordinated obligations and unsubordinated obligations issued by the issuer. The notes have priority over junior securities, which include ordinary shares and any class of the issuer's share capital, such as preference shares[1].\n\n### Definition of Junior Securities and Ordinary Subordinated Obligations\n\n\"Junior Securities\" are defined as ordinary shares of the issuer and any class of the issuer's share capital, including preference shares. \"Ordinary Subordinated Obligations\" refer to obligations, whether in the form of notes or otherwise, that are direct, unconditional, unsecured subordinated obligations of the issuer. These obligations rank pari passu with the issuer's present and future ordinary subordinated obligations, are subordinate to unsubordinated obligations, and have priority over deeply subordinated obligations, including the notes in question[2].\n\n### Parity Securities\n\nThe term \"Parity Securities\" refers to securities or similar instruments issued by the Issuer that rank equally, or pari passu, with the Issuer's obligations under the Notes. This also includes securities or similar instruments issued by a Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of a guarantee by the Issuer, which also rank pari passu with the Issuer's obligations under the Notes[3].\n\n### Unsubordinated Obligations\n\n\"Unsubordinated Obligations\" are defined as obligations, whether in the form of notes or otherwise, that are direct, unconditional, unsecured, and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer. These obligations rank equally without preference or priority among themselves and, except for certain obligations required to be preferred by French law, rank pari passu with all other present or future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer[4].\n\n### Covenant Provisions\n\nThe bond document outlines specific provisions related to the determination of interest rates in the event that the Independent Adviser fails to establish a Successor Mid-Swap Rate or an Alternative Mid-Swap Rate. According to Condition 4.3(a) \"Independent Adviser\" of the Terms and Conditions, if the adviser does not determine these rates before the relevant Reset Determination Date, the interest rate for the subsequent Reset Period will be determined by fallback provisions outlined in Condition 4.2 \"Fallback Provision\". This may result in the application of a fixed rate[5].\n\n### Interest Payment Terms\n\nThe document also mentions provisions related to the payment of Arrears Interest and Additional Interest Amounts. These terms are part of the Optional Partial Payment section, which details the handling of interest payments that are in arrears, ensuring that additional interest amounts are paid as part of the arrears[6].",
